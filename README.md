# Data Analytics & Business Case Studies

This repository contains a curated collection of data analytics and business case studies demonstrating my ability to deliver end-to-end analytics solutions across exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, SQL-based problem solving, and business-driven insight generation.

Each project reflects how data analysis and modeling are applied in real-world business and operational scenarios.

## Projects Overview

### FMCG_BCS
End-to-end FMCG sales performance and customer insights analysis using **Excel and Tableau**.  
Includes data cleaning, pivot-based analysis, and interactive dashboards for evaluating sales trends, regional performance, top products, and customer segments.

### YULU_BCS
Exploratory analysis of bike-sharing demand and operational patterns to understand usage behavior, peak periods, and resource allocation.

### AEROFIT_BCS
Customer and product-level analysis focused on segmentation, usage behavior, and strategic positioning of fitness equipment.

### WALMART_BCS
Statistical analysis of Black Friday purchase behavior using confidence intervals and hypothesis testing to evaluate demographic impact on spending.

### NETFLIX_BCS
Content catalog analysis examining content mix, genre distribution, geographic reach, and growth trends in a global streaming platform.

### DELHIVERY_BCS
Large-scale logistics data analysis comparing actual delivery performance with routing estimates to identify inefficiencies and operational bottlenecks.

### TARGET_BCS
SQL-based business case study focused on transactional analysis and business insights using a restricted dataset environment.

### LOANTAP_BCS
Credit risk analysis and default prediction using **Logistic Regression** and statistical modeling.  
Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and business-driven interpretation of risk factors.

### JAMBOREE_BCS
Admission probability prediction using **Linear Regression** based on applicant academic and profile attributes.  
Includes exploratory analysis, regression modeling, multicollinearity diagnostics, residual analysis, and regularization (Ridge and Lasso).  
Focuses on identifying key drivers such as CGPA, GRE, TOEFL, LOR, and research experience.
