# Data Analytics & Business Case Studies

This repository contains a curated set of data analytics and business case studies that demonstrate my ability to work across exploratory data analysis, statistical inference, SQL-based problem solving, and business-oriented insight generation.

Each project focuses on a different analytical context and problem type, reflecting how data analysis is applied in real-world business scenarios.
