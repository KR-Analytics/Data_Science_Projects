# 🚲 **Yulu Biz Case Study — Data Analysis & Business Insights**

## 📌 Objective
This project analyzes operational and behavioral patterns from the Yulu micro-mobility platform to derive insights that support better decision-making around fleet allocation, demand forecasting, and user experience improvement.  
The analysis uses hourly ride data and weather variables to uncover usage trends, demand peaks, and operational inefficiencies.

## 🔍 Key Business Questions Explored
- When does Yulu experience peak ride demand?  
- Which locations or clusters consistently see higher usage?  
- What factors influence ride activity (as a proxy for duration) and trip frequency?  
- Are there demand–supply imbalances during peak windows?  
- How should the fleet be repositioned for optimal coverage?  
- What operational challenges reduce user experience quality?

## 📈 Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Trend analysis (hourly, daily patterns)  
- Visualization of hotspots and usage distribution  
- User behavior segmentation  
- Summary statistics and insight extraction  
- Operational diagnosis using EDA  
- Interpretation of patterns impacting business decisions

## 💡 Key Insights 
- Peak demand aligns strongly with office commute hours.  
- Certain high-density clusters show predictable heavy traffic.  
- Ride activity (used as a proxy for duration) shows correlation with temperature.  
- Supply–demand imbalance leads to increased wait times in high-demand urban zones during commute hours.  
- Opportunity exists to rebalance bikes more frequently during demand spikes.  

---

## 📝 Strategic Recommendations
- Deploy higher fleet density in consistently high-demand corridors.  
- Implement dynamic redistribution during predictable peak times.  
- Strengthen availability in emerging high-usage micro-clusters.  
- Introduce incentives to balance user demand across zones.  
- Use predictive modeling to anticipate demand fluctuations.

## 📬 Summary
This case study demonstrates the ability to:
- Analyze real-world operational data  
- Extract meaningful and actionable insights  
- Apply structured EDA techniques  
- Communicate findings clearly  
- Translate analytics into business recommendations  

It serves as a practical, end-to-end example of applying data-driven insights to improve micro-mobility operations.
